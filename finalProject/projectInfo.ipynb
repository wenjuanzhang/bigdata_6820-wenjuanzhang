        "# Course Final Project\n",
        "My hope for this course is that it has given you practical data analytics tools to use,if and when you need them, whether in a future research project or as a data scientist in industry.   The Final Project is a chance for you to demonstrate that you have learned enough handle a machine learning task - on your own!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Relationship to Stanford's CS229:\n",
        "I am consciously modelling the final project on a similar idea from the Stanford Course CS229: Machine Learning.   The basic idea of the project and the final deliverables are faiirly similar.  However, there are significant differences: (i) our projects will all be single person projects, (ii) our projecs will all be science oriented, and (iii) our deliverables do not include a final report but instead a working jupyter notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goals:\n",
        "The  project should be one in which machine learning/advanced algorithms can be brought to bear on an interesting problem, either to \"solve\" that problem, or at least deliver meaningful insights regarding the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Choices:\n",
        "You have the choice of attempting a predefined project or coming up with your own.  In either case, **it will be necessary that the project has some reasonable connection to science.**   I am comfortable with the possibility that this connection may not be obvious, but if so you will need to make the case in your project proposal that such a connection with science exists.\n",
        "1.  **Already exsiting project:**  For these we will use the resources of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) website.   This website hosts open machine learning competitions for both commercial and non-profit organizations.  They provide data, background information, an evaluation metric, and a forum for each competition.   There are 19 open competitions and more than 300 completed competitions.   I anticipate that you may need to substantially modify the goals as stated on the Kaggle websit in order to be able to complete your project in the allotted time.\n",
        "2.  **You choose the project:** Here you are free to choose something from current research you are doing, or perhaps something you have been interested in learning about.   You are allowed to combine this project with a project from another class, though you must fulfill all requirements of this project.   More on this below in the FAQ.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Components:\n",
        "Hopefully this class has given you a good idea of how to approach a topic using machine learning.  For reference, both of the texts we have used include sections that highlight the important components of a machine learning project:\n",
        "*  **Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow**: Appendix B: Machine Learning Project Checlist\n",
        "* **Deep Learning with Python**: Chapter 4 Section 4.5: The Universal Workflow of Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Please consult these before choosing your project.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Timeline:\n",
        "These are the important dates for the project:\n",
        "1.  Proposal: This describes the project you will do, as well as outlining your proposed approach.   This approach may change as you learn more!  Sources for possible projects are listed below under **Resources**.\n",
        "      * Due date: 5pm Friday March 8, 2019\n",
        "      * Deliverables: Completed proposal form; see the file \"Project Proposal Template.doc\"  in the finalProject/docs folder in your github repo. \n",
        "      * Grading: No defined rubric is available.   This is a completion based grade: you will get 100% of this grade if all parts are done and it is turned in on time.   You will lose 25% (absolute) for each day it is turned in late.   I encourage you to share with me your proposed project ahead of the due date if you have any concerns that it is not appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Mid-term \"Report\": This is checklist of things you have managed to complete, as well as a  preliminary version of your poster (see below).  The primary purpose of this is to make sure you are on track to complete the project.\n",
        "      * Due Date: 5pm Friday March 29, 2019\n",
        "      * Deliverables: Completed checklist (see finalProject/docs folder in your github repo); associated items highlighted in checklist; current version of your poster (see  finalProject/poster folder in your github repo).   It is ok if most of your poster is placeholders at this point.\n",
        "      * Grading: A rubric will be available soon.\n",
        "\n",
        "      \n",
        "3. Completed project: A completed project will be comrpised of the following, all residing in your github folder:\n",
        "      * Due Date: 5pm Monday April 22, 2019\n",
        "      * A annoted jupyter notebook (one or more) which can be used to recreate your project.   Some parts of the project may end up using bash scripts and full python files in addition to or instead of jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "      * A final poster (in ppt *and* pdf form only - there is no formal poster session).    The final poster should be in a form such that you could give a copy to an interested party (future employer or research advisor) to give them insight into the kind of work you are capable of.\n",
        "      * Grading: A rubric will be available soon.\n",
        "      \n",
        "## Resources:\n",
        "Here are some online sources:\n",
        "1.  The Kaggle competition [website](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).\n",
        "2.  The UCI machine learning repository [website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)\n",
        "3.   The Stanford CS229 project [website](http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects.html).   The section titled \"Previous projects\" has hundreds of example projects from past years.  Note that posters only appear to be available for years 2015-present, and reports (something I am not asking you to do) are available for all years.   Many (though not all) of these projects are also based on Kaggle competitions.   Some particulary good examples of posters are:\n",
        "   * [Large-scale Protein Atlas Compartmentalization Analysis](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2018/poster/149.pdf)\n",
        "   * [A Data-Driven Approach for Predicting Elastic Properties of Inorganic Materials](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2018/poster/207.pdf)\n",
        "   * [Galaxy Morphology](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2016/poster/GauthierJainNoordeh-GalaxyMorphology-Poster.pdf)\n",
        "   * [Modeling and Optimization of Optical Devices using a Variational Autoencoder](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2018/poster/212.pdf)\n",
        "      \n",
        "## FAQ:\n",
        "1.   I found on the web a complete working solution to my project problem.   Can I use it?\n",
        "\n",
        "  No.   As mentioned above, each Kaggle competition has a forum of questions and answers devoted to that particular competition.   We encourage you to consult that forum!   However, as much as is practical, we strongly urge you to **not** consult any posted solutions.   This will defeat the whole purpose of the project: The value the project has as a learning experience is **much** more important than its contribution to your final grade in this course!  \n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Can I do this project as part of a team with another student?\n",
        "\n",
        "  No.  However, we do anticipate that many students in the class may end up working on the same subset of projects.   Consulting with these students about problems you run into and methods you are trying is fine.   But the work you submit as your project must be **overwhelmingly** your own.    You should be able to explain and justify every choice that is made in the course of completing your project.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Can I combine this project with another class project?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Yes.  In general it is possible to combine your project for this course and another class, but with the following caveats:\n",
        "  * You should make sure that you follow all the guidelines and requirements for this project (in addition to the requirements of the other class). So, if you'd like to combine this project with a class X but class X's policies don't allow for it, you cannot do it.\n",
        "  *  You cannot turn in an identical project for both classes, but you can share common infrastructure/code base/datasets across the two classes.\n",
        "  *  Clearly indicate in your mid-project report as well as an addendum (text document) to your final poster, which part of the project is done for this class and which part is done for a class other than this one. For shared projects, we also require that you submit the final report from the class you're sharing the project with.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   Is it okay to use a dataset that is not public ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Yes.  We don't mind you using a dataset that is not public, as long as you have the required permissions to use it. We don't require you to share the dataset either as long as you can accurately describe it in the Final Report.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Are the final presentations public?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Yes.   All projects will be viewable by fellow students via our classroom github repo.   We will also host final posters (just like the CS229 website above).  Let us know if this is not possible (because the data is private) or desired for your project.   We want to advertise this course and its potential to future students!"
