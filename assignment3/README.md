# Assignment #3
There are 2 files in this repo:
1)  ch1_scikit_intro.ipynb:  This is a more complex notebook introducing you to sckit-learn and fitting.   You can make modifications to this, but it is not an assigment.  If you do make changes that you want to keep, make sure to push from within colab to your assignment repo.
2)  assignment3.ipynb:  This is an actual assignment.   When you are done with this, make sure you save the notebook (from within colab) to your github assignment repo (which should be "assignments-yourname").
