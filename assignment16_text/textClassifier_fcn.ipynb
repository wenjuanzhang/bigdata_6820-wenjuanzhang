    "# Text Classification\n",
    "Thus far we have focused our attention on regression and classification problems involving data characterized by numbers: pixel intensities in images, features described by numerical values.  There have certainly been some cases where some of the feature data was text - for example the housing price data we started with in the first week of class.   What we did with that data was immediately convert that data to a numerical represention.   That was relatively easy, since the text data fell into a small number of discrete categories, which we could easily label with numbers.\n",

    "However, there are a large class of problems where the **only** information we have is textual.   What do we do in this case?\n",
