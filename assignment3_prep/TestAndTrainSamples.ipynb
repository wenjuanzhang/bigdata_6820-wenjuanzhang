This allows us to match the fractions for each of the carriers to much higher precision.   We use the same method from sklearn, but give it an argument that tells it which column in our data sample to use for the stratification.  Note that it is important that this column be a **categorical** variable - one in which the members of that column fall into distinct categories (in our case the categories are the codes for a small set of airlines)."
